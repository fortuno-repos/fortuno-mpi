*******************************************************
Fortuno â€“ extensible unit testing framework for Fortran
*******************************************************

The **Fortuno** (Fortran Unit Testing Objects) project offers a flexible,
extensible, object oriented unit testing framework for the Fortran language. It
puts strong emphasis on the simplicity of the user interface by minimizing the
amount of boiler plate code when writing unit tests, as well as to modularity
and extensibility by offering building blocks for customized unit testing
systems.

This repository contains the MPI-dependent part of the Fortuno project. Please
visit the main `Fortuno repository <https://github.com/fortuno-repos/fortuno>`_
and the `Fortuno documentation <https://fortuno.readthedocs.io/>`_ for further
